<h1>Jesus is not real!</h1>
<br>
<p>Jesus despite being the 4th son of God (after Adam, Eve and Simon Hypixel) is not real. Many "people" think Jesus is real but they are wrong. Firstly, I've never seen Jesus and I am the only person I know exists. I know this because of visions given to me by God I have seen that i am a brain floating in space in my dreams. This actually proves God is real because without god how could this have this appeared in my dreams? You might not know but this is true and valid.</p>
<br>
<p>Secondly, God isn't real, i confirmed this with god himself via my dreams. My dreams are normal and involve normal dreams things such as 7 Most Common Dreams. Researchers have found that the seven most common dreams involve being attacked or chased, being late, loved ones dying, falling, flying, school, and sex. (I know what my dreams are because of this website: https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-your-dreams-2795935). My dreams do not involve weird things. Anyways God (who is very attractive) actually never existed. This is true. Therefore the son of god Simon Hypixel and also Jesus also do not exist because god does not exist.</p>
<br>
<p>Thirdly, Jesus can not exist because people say Jesus did things that are obviously impossible according to the laws of physics. Jesus is said to have turned water into wine. This is impossible. Jesus is said to have walked on water, this is not possible if Jesus was a human but if Jesus was a small bug maybe it would not be impossible but I think if Jesus did exist he would not a small bug. Jesus was not a small bug in any of my dreams. I have normal dreams.</p>

<p>This was fact checked by True Jesus Patriots. I love you Jesus.</p>
